My First R Markdown File
========================

This is my first R Markdown File

Here we're going to load some data

```{r}
library(datasets)
summary(airquality)
```


Let's make a plot
```{r}
pairs(airquality)
```


Here's a regression model of Ozone on Wind Solar radiation and temperature

```{r}
library(stats)
fit <- lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Solar.R + Temp, data = airquality)
summary(fit)
```


Here's an unordered list
